## Introduction

This paper aims to explain in a simple and direct manner the basic functionalities and programming techniques used in the final project for Programming Techniques and Applications. The project was inspired by one of Kaggle’s 2016 competitions. “Kobe Bryant Shot Selection: Which shots did Kobe sink?” was a public competition in which participants had to predict whether 5000 of Kobe’s shots went in or not. Participants were provided with a dataset containing the circumstances of every shot in Kobe’s career. By using this dataset and by applying Machine Learning concepts seen in class, the final project’s program successfully predicts approximately 65% of Kobe’s shots. In addition to that, it uses the dataset to extract relevant statistics about Kobe’s career and provides them to the user.
