title: "THOUGHTS ON HAVING A WEBSITE"

I never thought I would be writting a blog post. How did I come to this point in live? I have a website now (well, not quite yet, there are still unfinished pages) and consequently I will be forcing myselft to post meaningful content. I always liked the idea about sharing my thoughts in a platform where I do not receive direct feedback, such as \"likes\" or \"comments.\" Not that I actually care, it's just that when there are people giving you direct feedback in terms of \"likes\" or \"comments,\" other people judge your work prior to reading it. "Oh that guy had 5M likes, he must be cool" and stuff like that. Why judge someone's work based on the amount of people that "like" said work? Anyways, this website will hopefully help me write down my thoughts and display my projects. It feels like the website will be a commitment and I will not want to dissapoint it. The hardest part will be writinn posts on Sublime until I find a better way, buy I'm confident there will be a lot of fun! Stay tunned.
