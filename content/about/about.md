I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at McGill University, Montr√©al, Canada.

I am a guitarist (and kind of a singer?!) at a garage band called Mango Bloom (at least that's the name of our band for now). We play mainly Indie and Rock, but we like to explore and somtimes play Funk, Blues, and some Pop. So far we haven't played any gig (mostly because we don't practice enough to have a complete repertoir), but a couple of our original songs have been recorded (you can't find them on streaming platforms, yet).

During the summer, I work at Westmount Soccer Club as a soccer coach for the youth. It's a lot of fun being in the field teaching kids about a sport I grew up playing.

I plan on adding more about me here, but so far this is enough. Eventually I'll add some pictures too.
