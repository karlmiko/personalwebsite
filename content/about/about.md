I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at McGill (Zoom) University, Montr√©al, Canada. I say (Zoom) because right now the Campus is as empty as the legendary Leacock 132 when I took this picture and most of the classes are being held on Zoom due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

When we could go to the campus, I'd spend most of my time in labs working on design projects, assignments, and reading about the stock market, investments, and the economy (now I do all that but from home, in confortable clothes, a few steps away from the fridge). Below is a robot my team and I built in our 2nd year for the class of Design Principle and Methods.

In the weekends, I try to find some time to play guitar (and sing?!) with our garage band called Mango Bloom (at least that's the name of our band for now). We play mainly Indie and Rock, but we like to explore and somtimes play Funk, Blues, and some Pop. So far we haven't played any gig (mostly because we don't practice enough to have a complete repertoir), but a couple of our original songs have been recorded (as you can see, they haven't been very well recorded therefore are not on any streaming platforms, yet).

During the summer, I work at Westmount Soccer Club as a soccer coach for the youth, and I also play in their senior team. It's a lot of fun being in the field teaching kids aged between 6 and 18 about a sport I grew up playing, and also being able to play competitively together with friends and coaches. I have been with the club since 2015, the year I arrived in Canada coming from Brazil. Here is a picture of our end-of-the-2019-season friendly match.

Moving away from Brazil was a big and exciting challenge. The country, the culture, the weather, the friends, and the family, are just a few things we had to leave behing to move. But we learned from the difficulties, we discovered great things about the Canadian culture, and we adapted well to the whole situation. Over the last 5 years I have grown a lot as individual, I have met so many great people, I started and completed College, and I'm now on my way to graduating from one of the top universities in the world. The maturity and knowledge I gained after moving is priceless. Here is a picture I took near the corner of Redfern and St. Catherine, Westmount, March 2015, a few weeks after we arrived.
